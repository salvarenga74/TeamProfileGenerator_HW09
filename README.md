## Description

In this application I created a Node.js command-line application that can be used to create a HTML website that displays the basic information of every employee that was entered by the user. The application was built without significant starter code and assumes that the first team member of the work team will be a manager. From there the user will be prompted until all the members of the team has been added.

This application also includes testing parameters for each employee and will ensure proper information is being inputted into the respective fields.

## Installation

To get started:

  * npm must be initiated and the inquirer package must be installed for application usage.


## Usage

When using this command-line application, the user will need to open an integrated terminal within the desired destination folder. After the necessary installations have been made, invoke the application by typing ``node index.js``.

From there the user will be able to input all desired information into the corresponding fields and a well formatted ``WorkTeam.html`` file will be generated inside the output the folder.

The application accomplishes this by integrating the inquirer package and a series of dynamic functions.
